# SortManager
This program contains a sort manager to allow the user to sort a collection of integers using three different sorting algorithms. These are Bubble sort, merge sort and Tree sort. The user will be able to input values and then choose there sorting algorithms. Furthermore, there is functionality to test each algorithm and time how long each algorithm takes to sort each array. The user if they wanted could compare these algorithms to test of which is faster. 

## Bubble sort

This sorting algorithm involves iterating over the entire array and swapping each value to the left if its smaller than the right value. This keeps on iterating until the end of the array.
